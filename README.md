# RayControlledWebsite
## Public Repo  
This GitHub repo will be Public, so you can get the experience of working on a repo that you do not own.
Since it is Public, be mindful of the information that you add to the code. 

## Instructions  
We are going to do the same things that we did with the Intermediate Webpage, but this time you are not a contributor.
So you will need to Fork the repo 1st. 
And when you submit Pull Requests, they will need to be approved, since you are not a contributor. 

### For this assignment you need to:
- fork the RayControlledWebsite repository
- create a branch using your name as the branch name
- create a yourname.html file in your branch
- commit the changes to your branch
- submit a pull request

### Then:
- update your branch from the main
- add a link to the index.html file to link to your page
- add a link to your page that links back to the index.html page
- commit to your branch
- submit a pull request
